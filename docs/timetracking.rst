The user can see their overall progress toward meeting assigned hours goals on different projects.


All Entries

The user can see a detailed view of all of their entries for the last week. This list includes all entries whose end time is in the current week, and does not include the active entry.

Online Users

The online users tab lists what all other users with an active entry are working on.
